This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Simple website with "giveaway" form

The goal of the project is to create a place where everyone can give unnecessary items to trusted institutions. Website with a simple form is intended to help users give unwanted items. The app is built with ReactJS.

### `App is still in progress`

So far the website has built:
- Home section
- RWD

### `Upcoming features`

There's still plenty more of work that needs to be done:
- Routing
- Contact form with validation
- Login/registration panel
- Fully working "Giveaway" form
- Login/registration logics (Firebase or Okta)
